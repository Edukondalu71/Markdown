## Real-time Markdown Editor with Live Preview

## Objective:
Create a real-time Markdown editor using Node.js and React. 
This editor should convert Markdown text to HTML in real-time and display 
the rendered HTML in a live preview pane.

## Task Details:
1. Markdown Editor Interface:
  Develop a text input area where users can type Markdown syntax.
  Use React for building the frontend interface.
2. Live Preview:
  As the user types Markdown in the editor, a separate pane should display the real-time HTML output.
  Ensure that the conversion from Markdown to HTML is done efficiently.
